# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Emil â€” Welcome to My Power BI Project Portfolio

This repo is a collection of Power BI projects I worked on during an amazing training journey with **Nicode Academy**, where I was lucky enough to earn a scholarship.

Under the guidance of my mentor **Anar Agamirzeyev** and instructor **Nicat Nabizada**, I got hands-on with real-world data challenges, built dashboards from scratch, and learned how to turn numbers into stories.
